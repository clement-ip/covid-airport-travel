# Investigating Airport Data in North American Airports in the year preceding (and during) the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Contributors: Anna Tang, Clement Ip, Erica Ho

## Description

In this project we develop machine learning models that extrapolate and predict how airport traffic will fare in YVR, YEG, YYZ, and YUL during the pandemic. We also analyze the correlation between airport traffic and the number new cases per day, as well as the cumulative number of confirmed cases. 

Results of our analysis can be viewed by running each of the available Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`), as well as viewing our report (see `Report.pdf`)

## Instructions/Pre-Requisites:
It is recommended that Python 3.7+, and the Jupyter Notebook be installed. These can be easily installed with the following commands (for Debain/Ubuntu):
```
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev python3-pip
sudo apt-get build-dep python3-scipy python3-matplotlib
```
Windows and/or Mac users can opt to use the Anaconda package found [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

Additionally, the following libraries are required for this project and can easily be installed with pip:
```
pip install scipy pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn scipy geopandas contextily descartes shapely
```
Work for each airport can be viewed by running its respective `.ipynb` notebook file.
